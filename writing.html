  <h1>On Forgetting in Writing: <i>Agua Viva</i> and <i>Awaiting Oblivion</i></h1>
  <p>
      In Plate's Amnesiology: Towards the study of Cultural Oblivion there is a clear tension between forgetting and the ability to express this term through the use of words (144). A problem at the very core of Amnesiology: In which, “the process of remembering produces memories; the process of forgetting produces–” (Plate, 145). Unsurprisingly, the English language falls short regarding the concepts of forgetting (Plate, 145). But this language limitation is merely a reflection of western thought and its lacuna of forgetting. Plate’s instinct to create an entirely separate field of study dedicated to Amnesiology is inherently flawed, as the act of forgetting and remembering are intimately intertwined. And memory, what Plate solicits as the product of remembering, is actually derived from a process that includes both forgetting and remembering (Plate, 145). For this paper I’d like to focus on the lacuna of vocabulary that inhibits Plate from establishing a traditional field of study for Amnesiology. I’ll focus on two authors, Maurice Blanchot and Clarice Lispector, whose attempts to tackle this mode of forgetting through literature also indicate the struggle of ascribing vocabulary to forgetting. Writing begets context and the oversaturation of memory; and both ‘novels’ are seemingly difficult to read. It’s as if both writers are swimming upstream, against the very nature of writing itself. In the context of writing, it is difficult to articulate forgetting.  </p>
 <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Prior to delving into the analysis, I would like to establish a few key terms. Plate utilises Proctor and Schiebinger’s agnotology definition of forgetting and forgotten: “The study of ignorance making, the lost and forgotten” (Proctor and Schiebinger, vii; Plate, 144). I’d also like to draw on the OED definition of forgetting: “to fail to recall to mind” (OED). Oblivion is “the state or fact of forgetting or having forgotten; forgetfulness; (also) freedom from care or worry” (OED). Drawing from Plate, memory is “a dialectic involving both remembering and forgetting” (143). But more specifically, I’d like to draw attention to Gudmundstottir’s framework of forgetting, where: </p>
 
<p style="margin-left: 25vw; padding-bottom: 10px;">
“Memory and forgetting are caught in each other’s web, and the complexities of the processes at work should not be underestimated. In this study, the forgotten, forgetting, or oblivion, will be our main focus, but without attempting to fully extract these terms from the web of memory” (Gudmundsdottir, 9). </p>
<p>
This framework is vital for the analysis of both texts, as it directly addresses the tension that Plate experiences when establishing the study of Amnesiology. For I believe it is this complex relationship between memory and forgetting that obstructs the ability to establish a separate field of forgetting, even one in the context of memory studies, as Plate attempts to do.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">After establishing working definitions, I’d like to establish the relationship these terms have between each other. Since Sir Frederic Bartlett’s Remembering, mainstream literature contends memory and storytelling are interlinked (Freeman, 1). In which one does not affect the other, but rather both become a convergence that creates an inseparable product in the form of narrative (Freeman, 2). Writing is built on memory and context. The act of writing in itself produces remembering. When we write, we are following the conventions of grammar and a shared language. When we write and read literature, we are partaking in the confluence of a shared imagination. Our minds conjure images based on memories and existing experiences. And it is this reason that authors struggle to write the act of forgetting. If we associate memory and storytelling, then narrative becomes the antithesis of forgetting. Thus, the struggle with finding literature that conjures forgetting lies in the requirement to eliminate an existing aspect of the narrative so make room for the act of forgetting. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Maurice Blanchot and Clarice Lispector both tackle this obstacle with their own methods. Blanchot does this through the anonymity of the characters; Lispector removes grammatical conventions and introduces a new syntax. In both works, I will analyse methods the authors use to achieve oblivion. Thus, in both works, there is a forgetting of an aspect of writing, in order to convey oblivion.</p>

<h2>Anonymity and Anti-Narrative in the Oblivion: Blanchot’s Awaiting Oblivion</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
In Awaiting Oblivion, Blanchot attempts to achieve articulating forgetting through the use of anonymity. The 'story' is set in a generic hotel room, one that the narrator, the man, notes the room is “no different from those he has always lived in… a modest hotel” (Blanchot, 7). Blanchot extends this anonymity through both characters of the book, in which both the man and woman do not have names or backgrounds, and thus no identity. But through this anonymity, the characters are able to ponder forgetting. The hotel room is "empty… and the words he uses apply only to the emptiness" (Blanchot, 7). Blanchot, through these attempts to describe the forgetting of identity, highlights the paradoxical feeling of attempting to describe forgetting. That is to say, forgetting contains a specific feeling of emptiness. Because to write about forgetting is to write about nothing; an absence. So to create substance, as Plate attempts when ascribing vocabulary of forgetting, would be to directly negate the very existence of forgetting. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Drawing on Emilio Lledó, Gunnthorunn Gudmundsdottir highlights a dichotomy of remembering/life/learning and forgetting/death/emptiness (Gudmundsdottir, 11). But Gudmundsdottir posits that death does not necessarily mean the end or nothingness. On the contrary, Gudmundsdottir posits the association of death and forgetting evokes a sort of rebirth for both the author and the reader. In which, in practicing forgetting/death/emptiness, the author and reader alike are able to derive new meaning from their oblivion. Such sentiments persist in Blanchot’s Awaiting Oblivion. For it is through this absence of words and identity, that the characters are able to ponder forgetting in the first place. It is their immovability, the death of context and plot, that creates the void, a space to contemplate the meaning of forgetting. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">More specifically, Blanchot meditates on forgetting through the existence of the void, and the characters' interactions with it. Blanchot’s forgetting is evoked most vividly when the unnamed man addresses the void that hangs above him and the woman. A void that if examined with:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25vw; padding-bottom: 10px;">“patience that enabled him to eliminate without violence all irrelevant concerns, he would not hesitate to conclude that the void was located at a place that he could have situated had he been capable of applying his mind more seriously to the task” (Blanchot, 15). </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
The man acknowledges that entering the void would necessitate the absence of plot and character. Awaiting Oblivion as a piece of literature allows Blanchot to explore forgetting without such consequences as forgetting people, his life, and his entire being. Thus, in Awaiting Oblivion, Blanchot is able to remove such ‘irrelevant concerns’ without personal consequence. The man can only truly enter the void “had he been capable of applying his mind more seriously to the task” (Blanchot 15). That is, he is not able to fully enter the void because he is, as many humans are, incapable of truly separating forgetting from remembering. 
Another obstacle that adds to the man’s inability to forget is the paradoxical efficacy that forgetting can not tolerate. The problem that lays therein forgetting, and what Plate struggles with, is the self-awareness of forgetting. As aforementioned, forgetting is “to fail to recall one's mind” (OED). Thus you are not able to consciously forget. Thinking about forgetting will directly negate the ability to forget. The man in Awaiting Oblivion acknowledges that he is unable to enter the void fully when he is conscious about entering the void. This tension also holds true in Plate’s question as to “why we know so little about forgetting” (Plate, 145). It is because, unlike memory studies, there is a tension that lies between being able to forget, while also being able to study the act of forgetting. 
Following Plate’s logic then, forgetting produces oblivion. So, to work around the lacuna of forgetting vocabulary, instead we could use oblivion as an indicator of forgetting within literature. A prime example of writing around forgetting; writing that cultivates oblivion; is Clarice Lispector’s Agua Viva. 
</p>
<h2>The Void: Agua Viva </h2>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
Although never directly addressing oblivion or a void, Lispector cultivates a more immediate state of forgetting. Lispector’s syntax of Agua Viva is a way to deconstruct the predetermined context that writing implicitly contains. Although similar to Blanchot in the anti-narrative, Lispector goes beyond to further break down the context of writing through the abandonment of syntax. The narrator addresses her unconventional approach to writing and the meaning behind it. On page 16, she expresses: 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25vw; padding-bottom: 10px;">“I know what I am doing here: I’m improvising. But what’s wrong with that? Improvising as in jazz they improvise music, jazz in fury, improvising in front of the crowd.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">It’s so odd to have exchanged my paints for this strange thing that is the word. Words– I move cautiously among them as they can turn threatening; I can have the freedom to write this” (Lispector).</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Writing is often a product of a delayed moment, but through Lispector’s syntax her words are brought into the present. That is not to say that she is writing in the present tense, but rather, writing for the presence of the reader. She does this by “improvising in front of the crowd” (Lispector 17). Her syntax is her improvisation; her crowd, the reader. Her writing is freeform and sticks to little grammatical conventions in order to break away from the pre-supposed context of writing as a communication form. And in writing in the presence, she eliminates what writing conventionally does for the reader; writing that creates a historical record; writing in memory. Her words are as alive and movable as she is. This is an alternative method of writing breaking free from context. And within her freeform writing, the narrator creates her own void. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">It is important to take notice that Lispector enters the void/oblivion without ever arriving at a vocabulary specific to forgetting. Forgetting is in the implicit nature of words. She addresses their precariousness when describing words as a subject she must “move cautiously among them as they can turn threatening” (Lispector 16). Similar to the man’s struggle in Awaiting Oblivion, words are a threat to oblivion; as words evoke context, memory and efficacy. Through a careless use of words, the narrator could easily deconstruct the void she has made for herself. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">She continues to stress the importance of words as a living entity when she expresses that “this is not a message of ideas that I am transmitting to you but an instinctive ecstasy of whatever is hidden in nature and that I foretell.” (Lispector, 17). Although Lispector does not write directly about forgetting, she is attempting to convey a feeling beyond words. Words are the tools of knowledge. It is through words that we are able to communicate ideas– but Lispector is trying to convey something different. Instead of words, Lispector wants to convey “an instinctive ecstasy of whatever is hidden in nature” (Lispector, 17). Much like Oblivion, this “instinctive ecstasy” does not lie in the existence of words, but something beyond the meaning of words (Lispector, 17). </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Through Blanchot, Lispector and Plate, there is a clear struggle to establish vocabulary for the Plate reading. And yet, intriguingly, the narrator in Agua Viva is a painter that abandons art and, instead, turns to words. If we revisit our understanding of the relation of narrative and memory, should art not be the way out of writing? To use a visual medium to avoid writing as a whole? The narrator in Agua Viva creates an argument for writing over art when she talks about “X”:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25vw; padding-bottom: 10px;">“Is “X” the breath of the it? the cold radiating respiration of it? Is “X” a
word? The word only refers to a thing and is always unreachable by me.
Each of us is a symbol that deals with symbols— everything a point of only
reference to the real. We desperately try to find an identity of our own and
the identity of the real. And if we understand ourselves through the symbol
that is because we have the same symbols and the same experience of the
thing itself: but reality has no synonyms” (Lispector, 72). </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">From her articulations here, it is clear that “X” is not the vocabulary of forgetting that Plate is looking for; “X” is not oblivion. Yet, there are aspects of “X” that might point one towards the feeling of forgetting. The narrator describes “X” to contain a “cold radiating respiration” quality (Lispector, 72). “Cold” is associated with death; death as part of the triptych of forgetting/death/emptiness. Yet, unlike Plate or Blanchot, Lispector does not use ‘oblivion’ or ‘the void’. To put a name to the act of forgetting/death/emptiness would be too specific, too binding. When the narrator asks “Is “X” a word?” She is not asking about the technicality of “X” as a word (Lispector, 72). Rather, adhering to the understanding that human communication begets the use of “symbols”, ie: words (Lispector, 72). “X” is a tool like words in narratives that convey a didactic overarching theme. It is not words that we should focus on, but rather the dialectic quality and the feeling we can derive from them. Does “X”, this mysterious, redacted entity even possess the ability to be encapsulated by words? The narrator argues not. Instead, the choice of words to convey feeling is to tap into the shared symbols of communication. The narrator acknowledges that to write is to enter into the “same symbols and the same experience of the thing itself” (Lispector, 72). But acknowledges the futile efforts of putting words together to convey meaning, because “reality has no synonyms” (Lispector, 72). In the phrase “reality has no synonyms”, Lispector wishes to convey the intangibility of entering the void. It is not a concept well attended to being encapsulated, because it is one that’s essence is in the negative space of a feeling. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, both Awaiting Oblivion and Agua Viva create a the use of “X” illustrates quite well the capturability of forgetting into vocabulary. Since memory and storytelling are interlinked, both works needed to deconstruct the inherent structure of the narrative in order to ‘make room’ for forgetting. Following Gudmundsdottir’s framework, when honouring the relationship between memory and forgetting, narrative opens itself up to address the lacuna of forgetting. Forgetting, unlike remembering and memory, is a concept which relies on what it is not. This then creates a lacuna in vocabulary– one that, with understanding, realises that it does not need to be filled. The lacuna itself is the vocabulary Plate attempts to achieve. </p>

<div id="CEREMONY"><h1>The Infectious Concept of the Nation-State in Silko's<i>Ceremony</i></h1>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Drawing on Benedict Anderson, Mostov proposes the Nation as an imagined sense of community that often arises by a shared identity (2). Subsequently, Nation-state arises from a population with a shared ethnicity and cultural background that desires to attain sovereignty (Mostov, 7). However, there is a contradiction. In order to attain citizenship, Mostov continues, one must “forget differences” of their own identity, to join a shared one (4). A final pertinent aspect of the Nation-State is that it is inherently gendered (Mostov, 8). Drawing on Charlesworth, in times of war, the Nation-State can be viewed as inherently masculine as armies defend their Nation from foreign penetration (Mostov, 8). In the context of Ceremony, Emo continuously struggles with forgetting his difference, his indigeneity, to engage with the Nation-State. Indigenous soldiers are able to enjoy the comforts of the Nation's rights. In this sense, the United States as a Nation-State becomes infectious, as it forces Emo, and many fellow soldiers, to shed his own identity to join the U.S and act on its values and needs. Both Tayo and Emo exhibit an internal struggle when acting on the Nation-State: Tayo with his sickness, Emo with isolation and a skewed internal identity. To act on the Nation-State’s interest, then, is to become corrupted, infectious. For both Tayo and Emo, the Nation-State’s imposition becomes a negative impact on not only their sense of belonging with the State, but within their own community. This paper focuses on the passage beginning on Page 52, “We went into this bar…” through Page 57, “The best. United States Army.” Within Ceremony, Emo explores the infectious concept of the Nation-State and paradox of citizenship through structural shifts, pronouns, disruptive narrative metaphors and a consistent juxtaposition of tone and mood.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The structural shift from narrative to poem introduces the Nation-State’s strength and imposition on Emo’s psyche and actions. The story of the thought-woman is the first instance of a poem-like structure within the narrative. Stories which, although are center aligned and arranged in stanzas, continue the narrative, instead of disrupting it. Within the larger context of Ceremony, the poem-like structures are the truths the Indigenous community live by. Emo is no exception. For Emo, the structural shift in the poem elicits the truth he lives by: if he’s a good American soldier, his citizenship in the U.S remains valid. Emo leverages his veteran and soldier status as a legitimacy of his identity and a person. The poem's content describes Emo’s sexual conquest, in which he “used Matucci’s name” in order to seduce not one, but two women from the bar (Silko, 54). By the end of the poem, he is successful. Immediately after, though, Tayo supplements another story, in which another of Emo’s seductresses finds out he’s Indigenous. She passes out in response. This jarring contrast of structure exemplifies the fallacies in Emo’s recountment. His instinct to shed his ethnic identity signifies the weight of being Indigenous within a United States context. That is to say, if he were to approach the women as Indigenous, they would not engage with him due to the Nation-States exclusion of Indigenous people. Instead, he longs to transform into an accepted identity of the Nation-State. Emo believes in the myth of the Nation-State, even if it actively discriminates against his own ethnic identity. The shift in structure is a visual indication not only of Emo’s entrenched beliefs, but the Nation-States' imposition on his actions.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The imposition of the Nation-State causes a loss of identity. The Melon smashing scene also communicates identity loss when one becomes a vessel for the Nation-State through the use of pronouns. Before Silko writes the Melon scene, Emo says “We blew them all to hell. We should’ve dropped bombs on all the rest and blown them off the face of the earth” (56). Initially, the pronoun “we” can be read as Emo and the army. But the military is the physical body of the Nation-State, ‘we’ becomes the United States and Emo. Therefore, prior to exposing the crime to the audience, Silko uses pronouns to establish who the perpetrators of violence are. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">As aforementioned, the ‘He’ can become the Nation-State, as it enacts violence to reduce his chances of penetration. The agent of the smashing is only referred to as ‘he’. With the added context of the ‘We’ pronoun placed right before this paragraph, ‘He’ also signifies Emo. The plural ‘we’ morphs into a singular ‘he’ when Emo enacts violence onto the enemies of the state, or, the Melon. When soldiers engage in nonsensical violence, they are no longer independent agents; rather, a vessel for the Nation-State’s interest. Thus, when smashing the Melon, Emo and the Nation-State become one entity. This is a direct demonstration not only of Emo's loss of identity, but his subversive desire to be seen as a legitimate citizen. During the enactment of violence, he can no longer separate himself from the Nation-State. They are one. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Despite this amalgamation, there is an alienation that arises with it. When Emo and the Nation-State become ‘He’, it is not an even exchange, but rather an absorption of Emo’s identity. ‘He’ is not acting on Emo’s desires, ‘He’ is action on the Nation-States’. Emo becomes part of the mix, but the violence towards Emo’s self still persists, as seen in the violence against the Melon, a passive object. The melon can be equated with Emo’s internal sense of self. As Emo, through enacting violence, becomes ‘He’, he is stripping himself of his identity. Emo, by partaking in violence, is further fragmenting the melon, the metaphor for himself. By allowing the Nation-State to influence his actions and motivations, Emo is further ‘forgetting’ his difference, and thus creating more turmoil as he violently degrades himself. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Through the melon metaphor, Silko also illustrates a disruption of narrative. The disruption of the narrative inflicts confusion upon the reader, as it disrupts the natural order of the story. The melon metaphor is disruptive, as it breaks the reader’s comfort with familiarity of the linear storyline by imposing violence within the story. Similarly, Emo is disrupting the peace by introducing, and encouraging violence, through the use of pronouns and mood. The melon scene’s untimely insertion recreates the paradoxical feeling of serving the Nation-State that actively discriminates against oneself.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Amidst all fragmentation, there is the consistency of Emo’s mood towards violence that is perpetrated in both the melon scene and the ensuing description of the U.S Army. Silko maintains the juxtaposition of tone and mood through two passages to emphasize Emo’s means for destruction. The scene of destruction is directly contrasted with the ‘He’’s mood. The melon smashing is done with purpose. The man takes notice that “the symmetry of the oval [melon] pleased him” (57). The contentment for symmetry establishes a positive emotion from smashing a Melon. Much like the order of the story, Emo’s actions are a disruption to the peace held when one engages with the Nation-State. Silko then reinforces this argument by maintaining Emo’s positive mood towards the descriptions of the U.S army in the following paragraph. The imagery of the army’s violence is undoubtedly violent. The mortar shells were praised for blowing “big tanks and trucks to pieces” (Silko, 57); and a “flamethrower that shaped a rifle into a melted lump” (Silko, 57). But in contrast, when describing Emo’s perspective on the violence, he can only fixate on his inclusion in the Nation-State and his connection to the United States Army. He was described to be “the best; he was one of them. The Best. United States Army” (Silko, 57). Tonally, it is clear that these actions are morally and ethically wrong because they cause death. But with the Nation-State at the helm of Emo’s mind, Emo can only see these things in a positive sense  because it allows him to engage with the imagined community of the United States. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">By maintaining the tone through both the Melon scene and the descriptions of Emo and the army, Silko frames the argument that Emo, by acting on the Nation-State’s desires, is simultaneously inflicting violence upon others and himself. For the United States, the violence is a positive action because it confirms the legitimacy of the State by reducing the chance of infiltration from Japanese soldiers. For Emo, violence is the currency to legitimize his citizenship to the United States. It is this mood that directly contradicts the violence of the Melon smashing. The smashing of the melon, then, becomes another visual representation of the fragmentation of one’s identity.  </p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">In conclusion, the Nation-State imposes its needs and wants on soldiers such as Emo, causing his own needs to become subservient. Silko presents this through the use of a shift from a narrative to poem-like structure, pronouns, a metaphor disrupting the story’s linearity, and the juxtaposition of tone and mood. The structural shift confronts the strength of the Nation-State’s ideologies on Emo. The pronoun shift demonstrates the loss of autonomy. The disrupting metaphor illustrates the harm done unto Emo and others. Finally, the consistent tone and mood once again shows the imposition of Nation-State. The Nation-State, as Mostov argues, is an ideal that is only as strong as its imposition on its people. An imposition, as displayed by Emo, disguises itself as unity, but only lends itself to more fragmentation. Through Emo, Silko encourages the reader to critically examine the implications of war, not only on the external, but internal as well. </p>

<h2>Four Fangs</h2>
<p>Every Sunday, we take a family portrait. Do you see what my Ma sees? <br>
It is quiet, except for sounds no one can control, like the chirping of a bird, and the rustling of the trees above. There is no other sound but those, though. The more I fuss, the longer this family portrait would take. Our instructions are to sit still, and we do.  </p>
<p>Ma is standing in front of us, checking our positions. My favorite part of these family portraits is when she looks at us with so much detail. When she is fixing my hair, she traces my face with her eyes, looking for any fussy hairs to pluck out of my scalp because they won’t fall in line.</p>
<p>“Such a gorgeous girl.” Ma says. Eyes not only look at me, but the air around me, Ma always looks at me with an adornment I wish I was more familiar with. It’s rare, but a smile does fit her face. It’s framed well by her brown hair. She tucks a final strand behind my ear. She kisses my forehead. It helps me smile. </p>
<p>The timer blinks off and we are waiting for the photo. A few seconds before the camera takes the photo, the wind picks up, and the hair my Ma took so much time to carefully place becomes out of plain once again. I look her way to try for help. When she looks back at me, her face is still smiling. I falter again when I see her smile. It makes me think about how dogs misread human smiles as points of aggression. Ma bears her teeth, her eyes are too wide, as if urging me to follow suit. And I do, just in time.</p>	
<p>Snap.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Ma says, as she clasps her hands together. “Same time next week!” </p>
<p>Every Sunday, Ma prints the new family portrait to put in a frame, on the coffee table, in the middle of the living room. Do you see what my Ma sees? </p>
<p>We are all dressed in white. Three smiling faces, lined up in descending order on the porch. On the first step, my Ma. The second, me and Da. His hand holds Ginger’s collar, because if it were up to her, she would run out of frame. This is the first portrait that I’ve seen her stare into the camera. She bares teeth of fear, they jut out like shards lined on the outer walls of a monastery. </p>

<p>Ginger eats in silence, and only at night. I drop myself and shredded chicken on the base of the steps, her preferred way of eating. It’s dark in the house, except for a few streams of moonlight dipping from the curtains. There is no fire. It’s unusual for the both of us to be this calm in such a cool environment. My eyes are closed until a few moments later, when I hear paws clack on hardwood floors. Next to my head, Ginger is licking the chicken off the floor. Then, she licks my face, and her tongue leaves a river of cool. </p>
<p>Ginger is soft, in all forms of the word. Her fur is soft as she rubs it on my face. A soft pleased grumble. </p>
<p>“What are you doing?” I hear from above. Ma’s silhouette asks me from the top of the stairs. Her shadow touches me. It looms over both Ginger and I. “You should be asleep.” </p>
<p>It makes more sense to get up, explain myself and go to bed, but I don’t move from my spot. Ginger, does. She walks up to her and rests her face on Ma’s foot. </p>
<p>Ma smiles, and sits down on the top step. Ginger licks her hand. I expected her to be angry and for Ginger to growl. But it didn’t happen. They sit together with a language I cannot decode. If only I could snap a picture, study it and decipher what it means. </p>
<p>My mother’s upper lip is stiff, it makes her look like she wants to say something. “Ginger’s like me. If someone hurts you, I have to fight them.” </p>
<p>This surprises me. I have always imagined Ginger and my mother to be at odds in their battles. At the base of the steps, I continue to look up at them. I don’t like the idea that Ma seems to understand Ginger better than I do. I don’t like that they understand each other. “I’m sorry I got angry at you before, I just know Ginger’s such a loose cannon. I don’t want you to get hurt.” </p>
<p>The light of the moon catches on their faces, my mom looks calm, Ginger’s curls into her hand. My mother looks almost wolfish, her hair untidy and her face practically warps into a snout. Ginger is under her hand, their eyes glow in the dark. </p>
<p>This image; it is the most real my mother has ever been. </p>

<p>The beginning of the end happens when I steal a toy from under my Ginger’s mouth and double blurs of hot white nip my wrist. </p>
<p>“Ginger!” I shout as I nurse my right hand. Ginger looks at me for a few minutes and stretches. As if nothing has happened, she runs to grab the toy from my feet. Her eyes are completely focused on the toy when she walks away. She grabs the toy slowly, her eyes never leaving mine. Before she leaves for the yard through the doggy door, Ginger glances at me once more, as if telling me something. Whatever she was trying to communicate, I didn't catch it. I glance at the clock and remember the time.</p>
<p>“Ginger bit you?” My mother asks, as she enters the door “You didn’t think to tell me?” </p>
<p>I did. But mother runs on her own clock. To her, the two minutes she’s been in the house is two days.</p>
<p>“We need to do something about this. We need to act, now.” She says, her back facing towards me. She is looking at the door, and then, she is looking at her phone. She did not stop to look at me once; doesn’t stop to check if I’m still bleeding, which I am. </p>
<p>I count the steps she takes up the stairs. I keep counting, until I hear her bedroom door click shut behind her.</p>
<p>When I know she’s gone, the dog bed pulls me towards it. In the corner of the living room, right next to the fireplace. There are days that the dog bed feels warmer than my own. Maybe it’s the proximity to the fire, or the separation, but it has always been nice to lie there. The bed is just big enough that if I tuck my knees under my chin and bring my hands into my chest, I can fit. Warmed by the fire, it’s nice. It supports me. </p>
<p>On my side, the water from my eyes falls sideways, over my nose bridge, into Ginger’s bed. I close my eyes and listen to the crackle of the fireplace. Outside, I can hear Ginger pacing on the porch. My scarred hand in front of my face. The blood drips into two streams, mimicking the fangs that pierced me. </p>



<p>The day my parents meet the vet to talk about options, Da beats Ginger with a shoe in the living room. </p>
<p>My Da takes his leather shoe and stuffs it into Ginger’s mouth. Ginger was just sleeping on the dog bed. A shiny black leather shoe, extending the path of his hand like one strong, cast iron blade. I want to help her, because I owe her this much. But when the cast iron blade comes down on Ginger, I close my eyes. I am stuck at the base of the stairs, watching from a vantage point. If it were Ma, I would reprieve myself by being in my room. But this is Da. I do not know what to do. Rooted, my eyes closed, I pinch myself to the rhythm of Ginger’s whimpers. But there is no rhythm, no pattern. The sounds scatter around the room like the remains of a shattered bottle, hurling glass shards to anyone who hears it. </p>
<p>My Da knows this is new for me. I know when he looks back towards me sitting in the dog bed. I want to ask why he is acting like this, but I don’t. </p>
<p>His cast iron blade. This anger feels older than both of us. </p>



<p>“Us making the dog crazy? It’s the other way around.” Ma mumbles at the dinner table. The dinner table used to be in the living room, but we’ve had to move it to the kitchen because any time we go near Ginger and her bed she begins to growl. “Why did she bite you anyways?” Ma asks. </p>
<p>Frozen, I decide between the real answer or one that she would want to hear.</p>
<p>“Well?” Ma presses. And I am out of time. She is angry, I can tell when she bears her teeth.  </p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I say.</p>
<p>“Well, this needs to be corrected,” she barks. </p>
<p>I am lucky that Ma never stops moving, so she misses so many mistakes. I look over at Ginger’s bed. Even now, it glows by the fireside. I wanted her toy. There is no explanation satisfactory enough for her. I don’t even think I can reason my possession over Ginger’s things to myself. </p>
<p>“We’re putting the dog down.” </p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, why? Because she bit a person.” Ma takes my hand. There are scabs and a little bit of scarring in place. “Look at this, we can’t take a family photo like this.” </p>
<p>Ma shakes her head, her eyes downcast, “We should’ve gotten you a boy dog. The bitch is always so much more territorial.” </p>

<p>In the office where Ginger is sentenced to die, overhead, white lights blast our vision. The sterile light burns everything in the vet’s office to a crisp, fine detail. I was hoping that the light would confront Ma’s decision, but in White, she seems completely in her element. She is leaning on the counter next to the examination table, where Ginger lies strapped to the table. </p>
<p>When I think of Ginger dying, and I have thought about it much because I knew I would experience it, I thought I would be 20-something; It would be dusk, we would be on the porch, facing the sunset; Maybe I would feel the warmth of her body in my lap receding, like a low tide, until it disappears completely, willingly, pulled inwards by the moon.</p>
<p>But here on the examination table, her head is covered and turned to the white lights above. I imagine what she sees now is just white. I guess that is not so bad. Ma says when we go to heaven, it is like stepping into a white box. </p>
<p>When Ginger dies, she dies like a flame that becomes encased by a jar. It is not instant, it is pulsing. Death swells a few times before it snuffs out.</p>
<p>After the injection, Ginger attempts to lift her head several times. I think about how I would not be strong enough to move my body after such a thing. Each time Ginger rises, her head moves from side to side slowly, as if she’s trying to shake the cloth off her head. I can feel the guilt rise inside me like a tide beginning to swell. Ma sighs. Da stares at the wall, he’s smiling but the ends of his mouth quiver from disuse. The expression is tense and unnatural. </p>
<p>With my chin pressed to the examination table, I wait for another motion from Ginger. I sit in front of her black nose, the sheet in front of it rises and dips with each breath. Another motion does not come. It is quiet, except for someone’s sniffing. </p>
<p>The white lights sear this image into my memory, yes, but it’s not one of Ma’s family portraits, printed clean on photo paper. This image is charred around the edges, embers refusing to snuff out. </p>

<p>Today, Ma comes home with her new family portrait. She does not notice me when she goes to bed. The family portrait is nice enough. We are sitting on our porch, in the same white attire as before. Three lying faces, all lined up for death row. First my mother, dressed in white. Second, my father, his hand on my shoulder. The hold he has on my shoulder is senile, my memories betray him. </p>
<p>The new dress makes me itch. And itching makes me squirm. I am moving back and forth when it happens. Da strikes me, Ma yells at me to stop moving. I am sitting on the bottom step. Da’s hand on my shoulder. I usually have no problem sitting at these things, but today, I had to tear at the hem of my dress to avoid running. </p>
<p>Later, when everyone was asleep, I put my face into her bed. Fear and calm. And then it, too, dissipates. The fire is out. I hold the frame of the most recent family photo in my hands. The fire is out and the cold draft is seeping in. I draw four fangs on the glass covering the photo: Two in Ma’s mouth, and two in mine.  </p>
