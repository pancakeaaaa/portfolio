  <h1>I WANNA FUCKING SEE A LIBRARY</h1>
  <p> <pre>
I wanna see a fucking library was borne from my desire to keep in contact with friends. In this zine series, we trade academic papers and respond to them creatively, or however we want. It’s a way to both keep in contact with friends and start conversations about what has recently taken up rent in their heads. 

Something I truly miss about being away from New York City was being able to talk through and about our finals AKA research projects. With my friend, Alia, we created a series titled, “I WANNA SEE A FUCKING LIBRARY”. The title is both an allusion to the slashing of library budgets in America, and a pun on our combined named (Alia and Bri: Alibri).

The following are a few images of the zines created. Printed on Ink-Jet paper. Hoping to eventually move to Riso.
