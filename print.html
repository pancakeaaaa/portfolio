  <h1>I WANNA FUCKING SEE A LIBRARY</h1>
<p> 
  I wanna see a fucking library was borne from my desire to keep in contact with friends. In this zine series, we trade academic papers and respond to them creatively, or however we want. It‚Äôs a way to both keep in contact with friends and start conversations about what has recently taken up rent in their heads. 

Something I truly miss about being away from New York City was being able to talk through and about our finals AKA research projects. With my friend, Alia, we created a series titled, ‚ÄúI WANNA SEE A FUCKING LIBRARY‚Äù. The title is both an allusion to the slashing of library budgets in America, and a pun on our combined named (Alia and Bri: Alibri).

The following are a few images of the zines created. Printed on an ink-Jet printer. Hoping to eventually move to Riso.

  <h1>The Publishing Gateway: FANFICS TO BOOKS</h1>
  <p>
My first ever publishing projects: From the trenches of Fan Fiction Websites to a literal book. <br>

Like many others in my generation, the beginning of my creative writing journey began with writing fan fiction on Archive of Our Own (Hereby, abbreviated to Ao3). Most fan fiction is published on websites such as Ao3 with just straight text in mind. 

<b><i>CONSENT IS KEY!!!!</i></b> Following similar parameters of the Zine Code of Ethics (CHICAGO CITATION), I made sure to contact each owner through social media to obtain consent (these are strictly personal projects AKA non-distributive).
