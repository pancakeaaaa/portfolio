  <h1>I WANNA FUCKING SEE A LIBRARY</h1>
<p> 
  <i>I WANNA SEE A FUCKING LIBRARY</i> was borne from my desire to keep in contact with friends. In this zine series, we trade academic papers and respond to them creatively, or however we want. It‚Äôs a way to both keep in contact with friends and start conversations about what has recently taken up rent in their heads. 

Something I truly miss about being away from New York City was being able to talk through and about our finals AKA research projects. With my friend, Alia, we created a series titled, <i>I WANNA SEE A FUCKING LIBRARY.</i> The title is both an allusion to the slashing of library budgets in America, and a pun on our combined named (Alia and Bri: Alibri).

The following are a few images of the zine created. Printed on an ink-Jet printer. Hoping to eventually move to Riso & to expand this to other friends! But alas, life is busy.

  <h1>The Publishing Gateway: FANFICS TO BOOKS</h1>
  <p>
My first ever publishing projects: From the trenches of Fan Fiction Websites to a literal book.

Like many others in my generation, the beginning of my creative writing journey began with writing fan fiction on Archive of Our Own (Hereby, abbreviated to Ao3). Most fan fiction is published on websites such as Ao3 with just straight text in mind. 

<b><i>CONSENT IS KEY!!!!</i></b> Following similar parameters of the Zine Code of Ethics (CHICAGO CITATION), I made sure to contact each owner through social media to obtain consent (these are strictly personal projects AKA non-distributive).

  <h2><b><i>Kalon</i></b> by Ryerim</h2>
<img src="../portfolio/images/Fanfics/Kalon.png">
<p>This 200,000 word fan fiction was my scripture during my senior year of high school. 
I wanted to memorialise it, and therefore, created the formatting of this book. 
Since it is a fan fiction, void of formalities of having a blurb, I combined the song I most associated 
with it, First Love Late Spring by Mitski (angsty, I know. I was a teenager haha). 

<i>Kalon</i> explores themes of co-dependency, mental illness and intimate relationships. 
Based on her own experiences with mental health and intimacy, <i>Kalon</i> contains an implicit dialectic nature, 
similar to a piece of ‚Äòformal literature‚Äô.  As a teenager struggling weathering the IB programs and the 
shockwaves of the COVID epidemic, <i>Kalon</i> lent me a foundation to reflect on my own personal relationships 
and the ways in which I conducted them.

    <h2>1. Consent n Cumming of Age (CNC)</h2>
    <p>
      My first zine was a final for a Gender and Sexuality class. Consent and Cumming of Age addresses the lack of sexual education at the Jesuit University I was studying in at the time. Among the three big private universities in LA, ours was the only without any sexual education/resources or title 9 support. In response to this, we created a zine about consent and gave it out during the flea market Wednesdays on campus. And to supplement the lack of sexual education and support in the school, we taped a condom to the back of the zine ;)

    <h2>2. Chen Mo's Zine Workshop</h2>
    <p>
      Asia Art Archive‚Äôs current zine resident, Chen Mo, invited me to a Dream Zine workshop. Based on my scholarly background of Memory studies and Amnesiology, I associate dreams with oblivion. The zine I created was based off a poem that I wrote based on a dream I had of my high school in the rolling fields of Japan. Below you can see the poem, and the zine created:
